## Trends and Insights

* Account opening declined in the month of February by 15%: this could be as result of cash crunch, as some customer may consider not to open as they may be unable to fund it.​

* Over 75% of accounts are open online: effort to continuously  improve reliability and overall experience on this platform must be sustained.​

* Relationship managers should cross-sell the bank's product with respect to FCY (USD, GBP & EUR) account types to encourage foreign inflows.​

* Customer reach-out campaign should be in place, (to be driven by Customer care/RMs) to help keep account operational and active: this will help reduce Inactive/Dormant account count.​
